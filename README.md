# Proj_07B_LDA_Diabetes_Dataset

This project is based on the "Pima Indians Diabetes" dataset, which is used for diagnosing diabetes. The code utilizes Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to analyze the data.

Purpose
The goal of this project is to improve diabetes diagnosis by leveraging machine learning techniques. By using LDA, we can predict the presence of diabetes in patients based on various features.

Features
Data Preprocessing: The data is scaled to ensure all features are on a similar level.
Training and Testing: The data is split into training and testing sets.
Visualization: Scatter plots for both the original and predicted diabetes data.
Performance Metrics: Calculation of model accuracy and confusion matrix.
Usage Instructions
Install Required Libraries:

pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
Load the Data:
Ensure that the pima_indians_diabetes.csv file is in your project folder.

Run the Code:
Execute the provided code in a Python environment. It will diagnose diabetes using LDA and display the accuracy.

Analyze the Results:

The accuracy score will be calculated.
A confusion matrix will be displayed.
